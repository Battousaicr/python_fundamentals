# How to define a variable?
# A variable always will have the following format
# name = value

# Option 1. Defining an empty variable type
x  = str()
variable1 = str()
variable_numerica = int()


# Option 2. Defining and assigning the value in the same time

variable2 = "Hi, this is a variable number 2" 
string1 = "this is the string one"
integer_variable = 10


print(variable2)
print(type(variable2))

variable2 = "Now this variable have another value"

# Defining an integer variable
number = int()
print(type(number))
numero = 1 + float(2)
print(type(numero))

print(numero)
